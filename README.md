# webpage_as_wallpaper
This project allows you to set a target website as your desktop wallpaper. It takes the URL of the site as input and uses ChromeDriver to visit the page at specified intervals. After each visit, it captures a screenshot and updates the desktop wallpaper using the `ctypes` library.
